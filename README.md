
**General Electronics Informatic (GEI) Website**

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involved the design and development of a professional online presence for GEI. The website serves as a digital showcase for the company's extensive range of services, including IT consulting, hardware sales, network installation/maintenance, and a suite of proprietary management software (e.g., GeiLab for medical labs, GeiPers for HR, GeiStock for inventory).

The primary goal was to enhance GEI's visibility, improve client communication, and present its services effectively through a clean, user-friendly, and accessible platform.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A code editor like VS Code.
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine (required for the contact form functionality).

### Installation & Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone origin https://github.com/ouss218/General-Electronics-Informatic-GEI.git
    cd gei-showcase-website
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies** (for the backend server)
    Navigate to the server directory and run:
    ```bash
    cd src/server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server**
    From the server directory, run:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The site should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or another specified port).

    *For frontend-only development (without the contact form functionality), you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.*
